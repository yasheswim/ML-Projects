Uploaded simple linear regression analysis R code on three datasets:
1) Using Experience v/s salary dataset to predict the salary figures.
2)Using weight gained v/s calories consumed dataset  to predict the gain or increase in weight.
3)Predicting delivery time based on sorting time.
4)Predicting what will be the churn out rate of employees based on their salary hike.

All the above regression models have been performed with necessary transformation techniques to obtain a minimum RMSE.GGplot library used for data visualization to show linear
